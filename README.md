## Getting Started

- install node and nvm (globally)
- run `npm install`


This command will install all the development dependencies into node_modules/ and bower_components/.  This command will also fire off the default grunt command which will statically serve the application and open the application in your browser.

## Development

### Global Tools

- run `npm install -g bower`
- run `npm install -g grunt-cli`

### Grunt Commands
